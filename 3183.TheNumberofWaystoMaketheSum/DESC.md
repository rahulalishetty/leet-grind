# 3183. The Number of Ways to Make the Sum

You have an infinite number of coins with values 1, 2, and 6, and only 2 coins with value 4.

Given an integer n, return the number of ways to make the sum of n with the coins you have.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

Note that the order of the coins doesn't matter and [2, 2, 3] is the same as [2, 3, 2].

### Example 1:

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**
Here are the four combinations: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [4].

---

### Example 2:

**Input:** n = 12
**Output:** 22

**Explanation:**
Note that [4, 4, 4] is not a valid combination since we cannot use 4 three times.

---

### Example 3:

**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**
Here are the four combinations: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 4].

### Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
