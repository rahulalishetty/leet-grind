# 191. Number of 1 Bits

<code style="color:rgb(40, 194, 68);">Easy</code>

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of
set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1

Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
