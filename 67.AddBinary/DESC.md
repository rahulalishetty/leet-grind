# 67. Add Binary

`Easy`

Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

Example 1:

```note
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

Example 2:

```note
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

Constraints:

```note
1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
```
