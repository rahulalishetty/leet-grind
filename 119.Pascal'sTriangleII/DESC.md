# 119. Pascal's Triangle II

`Easy`

Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

Example 1:

```note
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

Example 2:

```note
Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
```

Example 3:

```note
Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]
```

Constraints:

```note
0 <= rowIndex <= 33
```
