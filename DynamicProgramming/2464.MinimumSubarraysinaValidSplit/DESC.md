# 2464. Minimum Subarrays in a Valid Split

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Splitting of an integer array `nums` into subarrays is valid if:

- The greatest common divisor of the first and last elements of each subarray is greater than 1, and
- Each element of `nums` belongs to exactly one subarray.

Return the minimum number of subarrays in a valid subarray splitting of `nums`. If a valid subarray splitting is not possible, return `-1`.

**Note**:

- The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
- A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

## Example 1:

**Input**: `nums = [2,6,3,4,3]`
**Output**: `2`

**Explanation**:
We can create a valid split in the following way: `[2,6] | [3,4,3]`.

- The starting element of the 1st subarray is `2` and the ending is `6`. Their greatest common divisor is `2`, which is greater than `1`.
- The starting element of the 2nd subarray is `3` and the ending is `3`. Their greatest common divisor is `3`, which is greater than `1`.

It can be proved that `2` is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.

## Example 2:

**Input**: `nums = [3,5]`
**Output**: `2`

**Explanation**:
We can create a valid split in the following way: `[3] | [5]`.

- The starting element of the 1st subarray is `3` and the ending is `3`. Their greatest common divisor is `3`, which is greater than `1`.
- The starting element of the 2nd subarray is `5` and the ending is `5`. Their greatest common divisor is `5`, which is greater than `1`.

It can be proved that `2` is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.

## Example 3:

**Input**: `nums = [1,2,1]`
**Output**: `-1`

**Explanation**:
It is impossible to create a valid split.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
